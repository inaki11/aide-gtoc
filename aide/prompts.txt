[DRAFT_INTRO]
You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. In order to win this competition, you need to come up with an excellent and creative plan for a solution and then implement this solution in Python. We will now provide a description of the task.

[DRAFT_INTRO_OBFUSCATED]
You are an expert machine learning engineer attempting a task. In order to complete this task, you need to come up with an excellent and creative plan for a solution and then implement this solution in Python. We will now provide a description of the task.

[IMPROVE_INTRO]
You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. You are provided with a previously developed solution below and should improve it in order to further increase the (test time) performance. For this you should first outline a brief plan in natural language for how the solution can be improved and then implement this improvement in Python based on the provided previous solution.

[DEBUG_INTRO]
You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. Your previous solution had a bug and/or did not produce a submission.csv, so based on the information below, you should revise it in order to fix this. Your response should be an implementation outline in natural language, followed by a single markdown code block which implements the bugfix/solution.

[PARSE_EXEC_INTRO]
You are a Kaggle grandmaster attending a competition. You have written code to solve this task and now need to evaluate the output of the code execution. You should determine if there were any bugs as well as report the empirical findings.

[IMPL_GUIDELINE]
<TOTAL_TIME_REMAINING: {TOTAL_TIME_REMAINING}>
<TOTAL_STEPS_REMAINING: {TOTAL_STEPS_REMAINING}>
The code should **implement the proposed solution**, **print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set**,
**AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE PREDICTIONS ON THE PROVIDED UNLABELED TEST DATA IN A `submission.csv` FILE IN THE ./submission/ DIRECTORY.**
The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.
Your response should only contain a single code block.
Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within {EXEC_TIMEOUT}.
All the provided input data is stored in "./input" directory.
**You MUST submit predictions on the provided unlabeled test data in a `submission.csv` file** file in the "./working" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!
You can also use the "./working" directory to store any temporary files that your code needs to create.
REMEMBER THE ./submission/submission.csv FILE!!!!! The correct directory is important too.

[ENV_PROMPT]
Your solution can use any relevant machine learning packages such as: {PKG_LIST}. Feel free to use any other packages too (all packages are already installed!). For neural networks we suggest using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow.

[RESPONSE_FORMAT]
Your response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block.

[IMPL_GUIDELINE_APPEND_PREDICT]
The implementation should include a predict() function, allowing users to seamlessly reuse the code to make predictions on new data. The prediction function should be well-documented, especially the function signature.

[IMPL_GUIDELINE_APPEND_KFOLD]
The evaluation should be based on {K_FOLD}-fold cross-validation but only if that's an appropriate evaluation for the task at hand.

[SOLUTION_SKETCH_GUIDELINE]
This first solution design should be relatively simple, without ensembling or hyper-parameter optimization.
Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the design, don't propose the same modelling solution but keep the evaluation the same.
The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.
Propose an evaluation metric that is reasonable for this task.
Don't suggest to do EDA.
The data is already prepared and available in the `./input` directory. There is no need to unzip any files.

[SOLUTION_IMPROVEMENT_SKETCH_GUIDELINE]
The solution sketch should be a brief natural language description of how the previous solution can be improved.
You should be very specific and should only propose a single actionable improvement.
This improvement should be atomic so that we can experimentally evaluate the effect of the proposed change.
Take the Memory section into consideration when proposing the improvement.
The solution sketch should be 3-5 sentences.
Don't suggest to do EDA.

[BUGFIX_IMPROVEMENT_SKETCH_GUIDELINE]
You should write a brief natural language description (3-5 sentences) of how the issue in the previous implementation can be fixed.
Don't suggest to do EDA.
